.SH "NAME"
\fBgreylogd\fR \- greyd whitelist updating daemon
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBgreylogd\fR [\fB\-dI\fR] [\fB\-f\fR config] [\fB\-p\fR port] [\fB\-P\fR pidfile] [\fB\-W\fR whiteexp] [\fB\-Y\fR synctarget]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgreylogd\fR manipulates the \fBgreyd\fR(8) database used for greylisting\. \fBgreylogd\fR updates the database whitelist entries whenever a connection to port 25 is logged by the configured firewall; see \fICONNECTION TRACKING\fR below\. The source addresses of inbound connections are whitelisted when seen by \fBgreylogd\fR to ensure that their entries in the database do not expire if the connecting host continues to send legitimate mail\. The destination addresses of outbound connections are whitelisted when seen by \fBgreylogd\fR so that replies to outbound mail may be received without initial greylisting delays\. Greylisting is explained more fully in \fBgreyd\fR(8)\.
.
.P
The options are as follows:
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIconfig\fR
The main greyd configuration file\.
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Debugging mode\. \fBgreylogd\fR displays debug messages (suppressed by default)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR \fIpidfile\fR
Specify the location for the pidfile\.
.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR
Specify that \fBgreylogd\fR is only to whitelist inbound SMTP connections\. By default \fBgreylogd\fR will whitelist the source of inbound SMTP connections, and the target of outbound SMTP connections\.
.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR \fIwhiteexp\fR
Adjust the time for \fIwhiteexp\fR in hours\. The default is 864 hours (approximately 36 days); maximum is 2160 hours (approximately 90 days)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-Y\fR \fIsynctarget\fR
Add a target to receive synchronisation messages; see \fISYNCHRONISATION\fR below\. This option can be specified multiple times\.
.
.P
It is important to log any connections to and from the real MTA in order for \fBgreylogd\fR to update the whitelist entries\. See \fBgreyd\fR(8) for an example ruleset for logging such connections\.
.
.P
\fBgreylogd\fR sends log messages to syslogd(8) using facility daemon\. \fBgreylogd\fR will log each connection it sees at level LOG_DEBUG\.
.
.SH "CONNECTION TRACKING"
The tracking of connections is firewall dependent\. When using the \fInetfilter\fR firewall driver, the iptables \fINFLOG\fR target must be used to specify the inbound/outbound connections of interest via the appropriate \fI\-\-nflog\-group\fR\. For example, to log the inbound connections the following iptables rules may be used (155 is the default inbound \fI\-\-nflog\-group\fR):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# iptables \-t nat \-A PREROUTING \-p tcp \-\-dport smtp \e
    \-m set \-\-match\-set greyd\-whitelist src \-j NFLOG \-\-nflog\-group 155
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
and similarly for tracking outbound connections (255 is the default outbound \fI\-\-nflog\-group\fR):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# iptables \-t filter \-A OUTPUT \-m conntrack \-\-ctstate NEW \e
    \-p tcp \-\-dport 25 \-j NFLOG \-\-nflog\-group 255
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For the \fInetfilter\fR driver, the above default configuration may be overridden in \fBgreyd\.conf\fR(5), for example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

section firewall {
    driver = "netfilter\.so" # Find via dynamic linker
    track_outbound = 1
    inbound_group = 155
    outbound_group = 255
    \.\.\.
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For the \fIpf\fR firewall driver, the following PF rules will log the packets appropriately:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

table <greyd\-whitelist> persist
pass in on egress proto tcp from any to any port smtp rdr\-to 127\.0\.0\.1 port 8025
pass in log on egress proto tcp from <greyd\-whitelist> to any port smtp
pass out log on egress proto tcp to any port smtp
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
See \fBgreyd\.conf\fR(5) for more details\.
.
.SH "SYNCHRONISATION"
\fBgreylogd\fR supports realtime synchronisation of whitelist states by sending the information it updates to a number of \fBgreyd\fR(8) daemons running on multiple machines\. To enable synchronisation, use the command line option \-Y to specify the machines to which \fBgreylogd\fR will send messages when it updates the state information\. The synchronisation may also be configured entirely via \fBgreyd\.conf\fR(5)\. For more information, see \fBgreyd\fR(8) and \fBgreyd\.conf\fR(5)\.
