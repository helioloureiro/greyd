.SH "NAME"
\fBgreyd\.conf\fR \- greyd configuration file
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
This configuration file is read by \fBgreyd\fR, \fBgreydb\fR, \fBgreylogd\fR and \fBgreyd\-setup\fR\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The syntax consists of sequences of assignments, each terminated by a newline:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# A string value\.
variable = "value"

# A number value\.
variable = 10  # Another comment\.

# A list value may contain strings or numbers\.
# Trailing commas are allowed\.
variable = [ 10, "value", ]
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Comments, whitespace and blank lines are ignored\.
.
.P
\fISections\fR may contain many assignments, separated by a newline\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

section sectionname {
    var1 = "val1"
    var2 = 10
    var3 = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fIBlacklists\fR and \fIwhitelists\fR use the same syntax as the \fIsection\fR above (see \fIBLACKLIST CONFIGURATION\fR):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

blacklist blacklistname {
    \.\.\.
}

whitelist whitelistname {
    \.\.\.
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

Configuration may also be recursively loaded by way of an \fIinclude\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# Globbing is supported\.
include "/etc/greyd/conf\.d/*\.conf"
.
.fi

.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
The following options may be specified outside of a section\. A \fIboolean\fR value is a \fInumber\fR which takes the values \fI0\fR or \fI1\fR\.
