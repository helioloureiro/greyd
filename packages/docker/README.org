* Building RPM packages with docker

Using docker to build greyd RPMs is very convenient.

All commands are run in a checkout of the source directory.

** Build the centos 7 rpmbuild docker image

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  docker build -t greyd-rpmbuild:centos7 \
         -f packages/docker/Dockerfile.rpmbuild.centos7 .
#+END_SRC

** Make an RPM

Build and RPM with the source in the current directory and output the results
to ~/tmp/~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  docker run \
         -v `pwd`:/home/builder/source \
         -v /tmp/:/home/builder/rpm/RPMS \
         greyd-rpmbuild:centos7
#+END_SRC
